./script/generate oauth_provider

This creates an OAuth Provider controller as well as the requisite models.

It requires an authentication framework such as acts_as_authenticated, restful_authentication or restful_open_id_authentication.

If you generated the migration file (true by default), make sure you run

  rake db:migrate

include the following in your user.rb

  has_many :client_applications
  has_many :tokens, :class_name=>"OauthToken",:order=>"authorized_at desc",:include=>[:client_application]

For legacy OAUTH 1.0 support add the following constant in your environment.rb

  OAUTH_10_SUPPORT = true

Note, you should only do this if you really positively require to support old OAuth1.0 clients. There is a serious security issue with this.
