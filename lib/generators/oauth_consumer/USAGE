This creates an OAuth Consumer controller as well as requisite models.

It requires an authentication framework such as acts_as_authenticated, restful_authentication or restful_open_id_authentication that provides the methods "login_required" and "current_user".

See comments in generated controller for more info about overriding these.

If you generated the migration file (true by default), make sure you run

  rake db:migrate

See README.rdoc for more.
